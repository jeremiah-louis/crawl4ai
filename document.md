# Cloud deployment models
Public cloud: Services made available to a large industry group or the general public.
Private cloud: Services one organisation, whether the physical provision is on or off premises. Useful for large organisations who have specific security or resource requirements.
Community cloud: A specific community with common business model or requirements shares the cloud infrastructure. Could be appropriate for regulated industries like financial services or pharmaceuticals.
Hybrid cloud: Two or more clouds (i.e., private, community or public) make up a hybrid cloud, but each remains a unique entity. Can be used for load balancing across more than one cloud.

We can add the multi-cloud: Services that acquired from multi cloud service providers

# Cloud computing service models
SaaS (Software as a Service): Provision of applications with which customers can carry out particular tasks
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Provision of infrastructure and development tools on which customers can program and deliver applications
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provision of hardware on which customers can store data or run applications
XaaS (Anything as a Service) or "everything as a service“: The acronym refers to an increasing number of services that are delivered over the Internet rather than provided locally or on-site.
Data as a Service, etc.

### Notes:
Other examples of XaaS include Business process as a service (BPaaS), storage as a service (SaaS), communications as a service (CaaS), network as a service (NaaS) and monitoring as a service (MaaS).

# Enterprise Architecture
IEEE defines architecture (specifically for software-intensive systems) as:
“The fundamental concepts or properties of a system in its environment embodied in its elements, relationships and in the principles of its design and evolution”
Creates a holistic view of each part of the enterprise
All systems must work together to support the business

# Some Key Principles
Enterprises are constantly transforming
themselves to exist, survive and adapt

Enterprise Architecture is used to drive and aid the planning process

Solutions Engineering is used to drive the
solution architecture and development

An initiative is a unit of planned transformation

# Enterprise Architecture: Purpose
To represent and understand how the enterprise works
To capitalize acquired knowledge and know-how for later use
To rationalize and secure information
To (re)design and specify a part of an enterprise (functional, behavioural, information, organizational or structural aspects)
To analyze some aspects of the enterprise (economic analysis, organizational, qualitative, etc.)
To simulate the behaviour of some parts of the enterprise
To make better decisions about enterprise operations and organization
To control, coordinate or monitor some parts of the enterprise

# Enterprise Architecture Frameworks (EAFs)

<!-- Slide number: 23 -->
# Architecture Framework Patterns
Taxonomy/Ontology Based Frameworks
Zachman Framework: to model a large organization's existing functions, elements, and processes while helping manage business change.
IDEAS and DoDAF: International Defence Enterprise Architecture Specification (IDEAS), and The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF)

Process Based Frameworks
Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) TOGAF/ Architecture Development Method  (ADM): used for smaller organizations or projects where there are fewer moving parts and fewer stakeholders involved.
EAP (Enterprise Architecture Planning)

Hybrid Frameworks
New FEAF Approach (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework )
Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF)/ NATO Architecture Framework  (NAF) / UK's Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework (MODAF)

### Notes:
 TOGAF helps businesses define and organize requirements before a project starts, keeping the process moving quickly with few errors.
The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) forms the core of TOGAF
The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is the most used framework for enterprise architecture as of 2020[2] that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing an enterprise information technology architecture

# TOGAF – Architecture Development Method
The Open Group Architecture Framework
The TOGAF ADM is a very detailed process through which an organisation creates its Enterprise Architecture
It is iterative
It relies on extensive use and reuse of reference models, viewpoints and tools
Service-Oriented Architecture is noted as a specific architectural ‘style’
Steps in the TOGAF model address SOA specific considerations (e.g., where can services be re-used, do the services need to be available across different domains)
The concept of an ‘Architecture Repository’ in which reusable services, components or systems can be specified and used as needed.

# Comparison between frameworks
The frameworks can complement each other, with TOGAF describing the detailed process for creating the Enterprise Architecture, and Zachman categorizing the artifacts relevant for different purposes.
EA3 Cube attempts to capture such interconnections in the enterprise and attempts to enable the smooth flow of information required for decision-making.
The Zachman framework explains all the angles that an organisation should consist of.
TOGAF offers an easy-to-understand, step-by-step approach to developing EA and is hence easy to use, helping organizations and employees save on excessive training costs.
DoDAF filters information into manageable pieces and offers a common vocabulary for architecture content.
NAF (replaced MODAF) provides a standard for developing and describing enterprise architectures. It acts as a key enabler for acquiring and fielding cost-effective and interoperable capabilities

# What now?
You have defined a business-orientated Enterprise Architecture
An (IT) Service-Oriented perspective needs to be applied to that
Focus on services rather than on hardware, applications or devices
Linked to the development of RESTful services, SOAP etc.
RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web services work with HTTP methods like GET and POST
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol with specific requirements like XML messaging.
Recognise interdependencies between services
Research what services are available
Consider changing business and technological needs – where is flexibility required?
Protection from risks of failure or attack

# Summary
The early stages of a move to cloud services are very important
Defining the (Service-Oriented) Enterprise Architecture is a key early step in determining what cloud services should or will be adopted
An Enterprise Architecture must be formed based on a mix of technical and business issues and needs
TOGAF (and many commercial models from the likes of Oracle and IBM) can be used to create an Enterprise Architecture model
